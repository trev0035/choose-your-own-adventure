# Walking around the Market

You walk past the glowing stall, trying to shake off the strange pull you felt. Your cousin makes fun of you, "That stall is for tourists! Let me show you the real side of this market"

You walk more into the *tianguis*, passing stalls selling mole, fresh tortillas, and beautiful textiles. The smells of the market make you feel both curious and at home.
