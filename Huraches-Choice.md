# You Choose the Huaraches

Your feet slide into the sparkling huaraches. The ground feels lighter underneath as soon as you tie the straps, and an odd warmth fills you, as if the sandals are adjusting perfectly to your feet. It seems as though the ground is directing you with every step.

The market around you fogs, but the sound of sweet, strange music replaces the silence. The sky turns purple and orange, and the once-faded stalls now glow with vibrant colors. A soft breeze brushes your skin, carrying the scent of roasted corn and cinnamon. People walk past with blurry faces that make them seem unreal.

As you approach a far-off figure at the far end of the market, the huaraches push you forward. Even though you can't yet identify them, you sense a powerful draw. It seems like you're getting closer to something significant but unknowable with every step.
