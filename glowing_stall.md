# The Glowing Stall

You step closer to the mysterious stall, the old man’s smile is growing wider. "Ah, you like unusual," he says. 

You look at the three objects:
- The **mirror** that reflects a different landscape, something you never seen before.
- The **huaraches**, their shimmer even looks liked flowing patterns.
- The **jar of Polvo de Sueños**, starts glowing as if holding the essence of dreams.

And the old man watches with his wrinkled hands on the counter.
