# You chose the Mirror

The mirror feels warm in your hands, its surface rippling as you touch it. Suddenly, the market vanishes. The vibrant sounds and colors fade, replaced by silence. You stand in a forgotten corner of the market, where the air is heavy and the cobblestones are cracked. The stalls are faded, their fabric torn, and no one is around.

You turn to ask the old man for answers, but his stall is empty. The mirror in your hands shimmers, but the reflection shows nothing of the market you just left. A chill runs down your spine as you realize: Where are you?

A little lane leads into the darkness, lit by a weak lamp. The air seems calm, as if this place existed outside of time and is just waiting for you to do something.
